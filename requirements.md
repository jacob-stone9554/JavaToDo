### Overview
This is a simple to-do list application.

## Functional Requirements
1. Task Management
    - Add new tasks
    - edit existing tasks
    - mark tasks as complete or incomplete
    - categorize tasks (think tags like work, shopping, chores, etc.)
2. Task Details
    - Title
    - Description
    - Due Date
    - Priority level
3. User Interface
    - (will be a console app to start. plan on implementing a gui later on)
    - list view to display tasks with sorting and filtering options
    - A form to add/edit task details
    - Visual indicators for task status (e.g. color-coding for priority)
4. Data Persistence 
    - set up a DB in MSSMS
    - Develop what tables are necessary for the app to function
    - Develop DB documentation 
    - Implement the tables/DBs
5. Search and Filter
   - Create functionality such that the user can search tasks by title or description
   - Filter tasks by category, priority, or completion status
6. (OPTIONAL) Notifications
    - Be able to alerts for upcoming due dates

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance
   - Efficient handling of a large number of tasks
   - Quick response time for UI interactions (once implemented)
2. Usability
   - Intuitive and easy-to-use interface
   - Clear instructions and error messages
3. Reliability
   - Ensure data integrity when saving and loading tasks
   - Handle exceptions and errors gracefully
4. Compatibility
    - Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - Use JavaFX for the GUI to ensure modern and consistent UI
5. Scalability
    - Design the application to handle future feature expansions
6. Security
    - Ensure secure handling of any personal data
    - Implement basic user authentication if multi-user support is needed (not sure yet)
